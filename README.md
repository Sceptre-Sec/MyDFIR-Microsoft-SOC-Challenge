# MyDFIR Microsoft SOC Challenge

From pentesting labs to SOC investigations — turning curiosity and persistence into defence.  
This repository documents my progress through the **MyDFIR 30-Day Microsoft SOC Analyst Challenge** a hands-on journey into the blue team world.

## About the Journey
I’ve joined the **MyDFIR Skool**, a community of like minded people from all backgrounds learning together in a structured, supportive environment created by our guru himself — **MyDFIR Steven Mah**.  
There’s so much happening every week: Capture the Flag events, new investigation scenarios and constantly updated learning material. It’s practical, challenging and incredibly well organised.  

This challenge is helping me to bridge the gap from offensive security thinking to defensive investigation. Learning how to detect, respond and tell the story behind an attack.

## What This Repo Represents
This is more than just notes — it’s a record of my learning process, my mistakes, and my wins along the way.  
It shows how much you can achieve when curiosity meets structure and a great community.
