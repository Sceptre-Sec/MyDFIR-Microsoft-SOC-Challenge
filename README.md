# MyDFIR Microsoft SOC Challenge

From pentesting labs to SOC investigations — turning curiosity and persistence into defence.  
This repository documents my progress through the **MyDFIR 30-Day Microsoft SOC Analyst Challenge**, a hands-on journey into the blue team world.

## About the Journey
I’ve joined the **MyDFIR Skool**, a community of like-minded people from all backgrounds learning together in a structured, supportive environment created by our guru himself — **MyDFIR Steven Mah**.  
There’s so much happening every week: Capture the Flag events, new investigation scenarios and constantly updated learning material. It’s practical, challenging and incredibly well organised.  

This challenge is helping me to bridge the gap from offensive security thinking to defensive investigation — learning how to detect, respond, and tell the story behind an attack.
